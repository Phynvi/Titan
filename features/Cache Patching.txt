Cache Patching:
	- Create a set of folders which allows the server to read from it and "patch" cache files
	
Project/
	data/
	cache/
	cache_patches/
		idx13/
			file511.replace
			
Where file511.replace will be loaded at runtime "replacing" the cache file whenever it is requested. Eg,
the actual cache/ folder is not modified, but the API will attempt to retrieve the file from cache_patches
first or fail and return the real cache file. This would allow admins to drag and drop custom NPC, Item,
Music, etc files without too much issue.
