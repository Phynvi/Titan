Ticks:
	Runescape operates on a 600ms tick cycle. Every 600ms, all players are sent an update.
	
	Notable facts about our tick cycle:
		- Tickable classes may subscribe to server ticks via Core.getServer().getTicker().subscribe(this, [delay > 0])
		
		- A class that is subscribed will have the tick() method invoked, compared to one that is not.
		
		- The ticks are not first come, first serve when calling submit():
			- Every second tick, all tickables to be run() on that tick, will have their run() method called in the opposite
			  order, as compared to every even tick. This is to prevent players from being 'one tick ahead' of another.
		
		- The return value of the tick() method indicates whether the Tickable object should be rescheduled. If the value is
		  greater than 0, then the Tickable object is scheduled to be run after [value] ticks. Else, the Tickable object is
		  removed from the schedule entirely, until resubscribed by some other section of code.
		  
		- The ActionQueue will require a Mob be tick()'ed on each tick if the queue has actions in it. Thus a mob should
		  be the one managing its own action queue, and no external classes other than actions should modify it.
