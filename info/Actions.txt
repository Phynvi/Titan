Actions Information:
	Definitions:
		Action: Something a player may do. This is a runnable class.
				- Examples include Eating, Walking, Following, Combat, Herb Cleaning, Spell Casting, etc.
		ActionQueue: The list of Actions a player wants to perform at this point in time. Items in this list
					 may be cancelled or reorganised as the player interacts with the server.
					 
How it works:
	* A player requests to do something, eg "Follow Frizire"
	* A new "FollowAction" is constructed, and given to the players ActionQueue
		- Eg FollowAction f = new FollowAction(follower, target, 1, 8, new AStar();
			 getPlayer().getActions().queue(f);
	* The ActionQueue the subscribes the Mob (Player) to tick notifications
	* The server then calls tick() on the Mob (Player)
	* The tick() method from Mob (Player) then invokes the tick() method on the ActionQueue
	* The ActionQueue's tick() method runs, performing whatever actions necessary and returns
	* The return value from ActionQueue.tick() indicates whether the ActionQueue requires to be ticked again.
	* A value of 1 indicates 'tick again', but -1 indicates 'queue is empty'.
	* Mob (Player) class handles the result, if there are no other reasons to tick() then mob unsubscribes to server ticks
