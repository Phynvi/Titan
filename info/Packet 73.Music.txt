Outgoing Packet 73: Music.

Length: 4
		- ByteC
		- ByteC
		- LEShort
		
ByteC:
	This is the volume of the packet on a scale of 0-255, 0 being quietest.
	
ByteC:
	This appears to be a fade in time, the amount of time (in unknown units)
	that it takes for the song that is previously playing to be faded out. 
	A value of 50 seems fair.
	
LEShort:
	This is the ID of the song to play. This number is actually read by
	the client as an unsigned short, though the data is indexed using
	LEShorts on the client, meaning we should write LEShorts to them.


When the player logs in, or the current song finishes playing, the player
sends a packet to the server (Opcode 42), containing the trackId(int) that
was last played by the client. Opcode 42 is 1 int in size.
