Release:
	- JAR version
	- AIArmy AI's aren't wandering when they have nothing to do
	
Code Quality:
	- Some item prices are displayed differently in general stores based on stock quantity. Why?
	- Hide Definition classes, only expose them to the instances of those definitons, and make those instances
	  provide methods for accessing fields of the definitions.
	- Move common protocol methods to ProtocolHandler.java 
	- Factions
		- Set wilderness faction on entering wilderness
	- Sounds
		- Weapon Sounds
		- Defensive sounds
	- toString() for all classes
	- YML configuration properly

	- Search for all unused classes
		
Alva:
	- Duel Arena Module
	- Lobby button handling
	
Modules:
	- Dependency System
		- Hard dependencies (Required ones)
		- Soft dependencies (Non-required but should be loaded before)

Interfaces:
	- Interfaces should be aware of their childPos for both fixed and resizeable screen sizes
		- Currently it is done in the constructor (p.getScreen().getMode() < 2 ? 216 : 95)
		- Required to swap between fixed and resizeable screens

Bug Fixes:
	- Client graphics files seem incorrect/have low FPS/native library functions don't map properly/dependency required for native libs
		- World models/terrain not displaying properly/totally/partially.
		- Due to JDK which doesn't include jawt.dll in jdk/bin/ directory.
		- JRE7 does not have the same issue.
		- Eclipse somehow auto-includes jawt.dll or something with the required functionality
		- Solutions?
			- Run client with JRE instead, warning if JDK
			- Distribute jawt.dll/jawt.so(?) with client
	- Range weapons such as Darts/Javelins/Thrown axes should not include stat bonuses from Arrows/Bolts, but they do.
	- Crystal bow shoots bow as ammo
