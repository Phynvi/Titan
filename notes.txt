Release:
	Update Mask: 
		- Disable mask updating if no Client Player's are online
		- Improve logon server packets.
	
LogonServer:
	- Stop using magic numbers for packet opcodes
	- RemoteProtocol.java class to forward protocol requests to another server.
	- Accept a CommandManager and ConsoleSender in Constructor for LogonServer
	
- Clean out unused .jar dependencies
- Add sqlite database, use as default
- Automatically load all .jars from lib/ folder
- Force check that logon and world SQLite .db files are not the same file!
	
Code Quality:
	- Some item prices are displayed differently in general stores based on stock quantity. Why?
	- Hide Definition classes, only expose them to the instances of those definitons, and make those instances
	  provide methods for accessing fields of the definitions.
	- Move common protocol methods to ProtocolHandler.java
	- Being attacked cancels a walking action 
	- Factions
		- Set wilderness faction on entering wilderness
	- Sounds
		- Weapon Sounds
		- Defensive sounds
	- toString() for all classes
	- YML configuration properly
		- Constructors?
	- Dialogue interfaces
	- exit to lobby is broken again (must wait to write buffered all data to socket before closing socket)
	
Bots:
	- checkAttacks() on each loop
		- checkAttacks() should ensure player has bow ammo if ranging
		- check for runes if autocasting
	- On equip,
		- If using a bow, ensure has ammo if ranging
	- If bots cannot find bank, use teleport.
	- Won't equip whip if not wielding a weapon?
		
Alva:
	- Duel Arena Module
	- Lobby button handling
	
Modules:
	- Dependency System
		- Hard dependencies (Required ones)
		- Soft dependencies (Non-required but should be loaded before)

Interfaces:
	- Interfaces should be aware of their childPos for both fixed and resizeable screen sizes
		- Currently it is done in the constructor (p.getScreen().getMode() < 2 ? 216 : 95)
		- Required to swap between fixed and resizeable screens

Bug Fixes:
	- Client graphics files seem incorrect/have low FPS/native library functions don't map properly/dependency required for native libs
		- World models/terrain not displaying properly/totally/partially.
		- Due to JDK which doesn't include jawt.dll in jdk/bin/ directory.
		- JRE7 does not have the same issue.
		- Eclipse somehow auto-includes jawt.dll or something with the required functionality
		- Solutions?
			- Run client with JRE instead, warning if JDK
			- Distribute jawt.dll/jawt.so(?) with client
	- Range weapons such as Darts/Javelins/Thrown axes should not include stat bonuses from Arrows/Bolts, but they do.
	- Crystal bow shoots bow as ammo
