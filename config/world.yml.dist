# How frequently should we save players? Lower values mean less of a rollback, but too low values will crash a server that can't keep up with the number of players online

# Time in milliseconds between sending "update masks" to players. Lower values will make the
# server seem to respond faster (Eg when starting movement), but will require more bandwidth
# and processing time. Higher values will make the server seem slower to respond, but will

formula:
   # Variables allowed are:
   # skill_level - the skill for this category. Eg if you are doing the melee category, you will get ATK/STR/DEF appropriately, or the magic category you will get MAGIC levels.
   # skill_level_* - Where * is a skill in lowercase. Eg magic, defence, strength, constitution, herblore, fishing
   #  - All skill levels include current modifier.
   # equip_bonus - The equipment stat bonus for this case. This is the same as Mob.getEquipment().getBonus(Bonus.*_*). The bonus type will be the appropriate one to the mob's attack or defence
   #  - Eg, magic.defence will be the value for Bonus.DEF_MAGIC, melee.power will be Bonus.POW_STRENGTH, range.hit will be Bonus.ATK_RANGE and melee.hit will be the bonus used for the current attack style (Bonus.ATK_STAB/SLASH/CRUSH appropriately)
   # prayer_multiplier will be the increase/decrease from active prayers. This will be 1.0 by default. A value of 1.0 represents no prayers active. This is supplied for NPC's too.
   # prayer_multiplier_* - Where * is a skill in lowercase. Eg prayer_multiplier_herblore or prayer_multiplier_defence
