 Coding:
 	- "IF" statements are to be verbose:
 	  if(coding) {
 	  	sleep();
 	  }
 	  else {
 	  	yield();
 	  }
 	  
 	- A space is required between ) and a {
 	- Group abstract methods
 	- Group Constructors
 	- Group getters/setters
 	- Variables to be declared at top of classes, above constructor
 	- Static variables to be declared above dynamic variables
 	- Output to be printed with Log.log() not System.out
 	- Magic numbers may be used internally, but are NEVER to be part of an exposed method or value
 
 Structure:
 	- Structures should be well thought out
 		- Revision of poor structures is encouraged
 	- Encapsulation is encouraged, it is neater and easily understood
 	- Readability of code must be high
 	- Structures must update other data when publically accessible. For example,
 	  no refresh() method should be required. An example of this is the player's
 	  inventory, where Inventory.set() updates the client. This is functional.
 	  A bad example is where Inventory.set() might not update the client until
 	  a refresh() call is made.
 	
 Documenting:
 	- Javadocs for all non-trivial methods
 	- Javadocs for all protected or public variables
 	- Javadocs must specify all Exceptions raised from methods specifically, even if Runtime
 	- Comment on non-trivial methods
 	- Use // for single or double line comments. Triple may use /* */ 
 	- Non-trivial concepts must be documented in the 'info' folder specifying
 	  what they are, how they're to be used, and any nuances.
